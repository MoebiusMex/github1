# Everything about Flight Simulators
Here I will explain something (all of them) about the history and current flight simulators.

## History of Flight Simulators
The first version was from _Sublogic_, which later was acquired by **Microsoft**.
After that Microsoft continued with its developement.
This is a picture from the first flight simulator.

## First features
In the first version, it has a single surface made with a grid, and another vertical plane with some mountains.
I will show you some code:
```
	int a, b=0;
	return 0;
```
